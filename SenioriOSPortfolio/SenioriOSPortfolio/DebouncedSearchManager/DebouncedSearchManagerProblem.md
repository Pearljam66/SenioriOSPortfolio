# Debounced Search Manager Problem

**Question: Debounced Search Manager**

## Description:
Build a SearchManager class in Swift that:

- Performs an async search (e.g., API call) based on user input.  
- Debounces requests to limit calls (e.g., wait 0.5 seconds after typing stops).  
- Caches recent search results locally.

## Requirements:  
- Use async/await for the search operation.  
- Implement debouncing with Task and cancellation.  
- Store results in a dictionary or NSCache.  
- **Timeframe: 55 minutes**
