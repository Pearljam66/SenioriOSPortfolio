# Rate-Limited API Client Problem

## Question: 
**Rate-Limited API Client**

## Description:
Build an APIClient class in Swift that:  
- Fetches JSON data from a given URL.  
- Enforces a rate limit (e.g., max 5 requests per second).
- Retries failed requests with exponential backoff.

## Requirements:  
- Use async/await for network calls.  
- Implement rate limiting with a queue or timer mechanism.
- Handle errors (e.g., network failure, rate limit exceeded).  
- **Timeframe: 60 minutes**
