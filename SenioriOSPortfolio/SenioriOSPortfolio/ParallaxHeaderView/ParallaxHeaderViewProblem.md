# Parallax Header View Problem

**Question: Parallax Header View**

## Description:
Create a ParallaxHeaderView for a UIScrollView that: 
 
- Displays an image header that scales and moves as the user scrolls.  
- Fades the image opacity based on scroll position.  
- Pins the header at a minimum height when scrolled up.

## Requirements:  
- Use UIScrollViewDelegate to track scroll events.  
- Apply transforms and opacity changes dynamically.  
- Ensure smooth performance during scrolling.  
- **Timeframe: 50 minutes**
