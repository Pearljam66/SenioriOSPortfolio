# LRU Cache Implementation Problem

**Question: LRU Cache Implementation**

## Description:
Design an LRUCache in Swift that:
  
- Stores key-value pairs with a fixed capacity.  
- Evicts the least recently used item when capacity is exceeded.  
- Supports get(key) and put(key, value) operations.

## Requirements:  
- Use a combination of dictionary and doubly linked list for O(1) complexity.  
- Ensure thread safety (e.g., with NSLock or actor).  
- Handle edge cases (e.g., empty cache, invalid keys).  
- **Timeframe: 60 minutes**
