# Senior iOS Portfolio

A collection of advanced iOS coding challenges and solutions. Designed as a portfolio to demonstrate problem-solving, architecture, and best practices for modern iOS development.

## Technologies Used
- **Swift**: Primary language for all implementations.
- **UIKit**: Core framework for UI-based challenges.
- **Swift Concurrency**: `async/await` and `Task` for modern asynchronous programming.
- **XCTest**: Unit testing for validation and reliability.
- Additional tools (e.g., `CALayer`, `URLSession`, `NSCache`) as required by specific problems.

## Problems & Solutions

Below is a growing list of challenges Iâ€™ve tackled. Each problem is organized into its own folder with clear, reusable code and accompanying tests where applicable.
